👋 Hi, I'm Rakesh Kumar (@Rakkee56)

👀 I'm a Senior Data Engineer with over 4.5 years of experience in SQL, PLSQL, and UNIX. I have a strong foundation in database management and scripting. My skills include using Jira, Open Reports, and Jasper Reports for project management and reporting, along with SQL Developer, PLSQL Developer, Putty, WinSCP, and Velocity Application for efficient development and deployment. I'm also experienced in performance and query tuning, optimizing SQL queries, database parameters, and memory management to ensure optimal application performance.

🌱 Currently, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge in data engineering and exploring new tools and technologies in the field.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on data engineering projects and open-source initiatives related to database management and performance optimization.
